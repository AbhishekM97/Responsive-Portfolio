                <p>I'm a member of a social secret greek organization that goes by the name PIKE, which is short for Pi Kappa Alpha. This fraternity was founded at the University of Virginia in 1868. My affilitation is with the Kappa Theta chapter at George Mason University. I joined this fraternity because I wanted to be a well rounded individual with technical and Communication skills. This organization has also allowed me to make strong connections with friends in school and has helped me sharpen my communication skills.</p>

Recently I attained my Citizen Ship to the USA. Also I am fluent in Inida's Native Language Hindi as well as, English.</p>
